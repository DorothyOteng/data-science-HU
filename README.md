# Data Science HU

This repository contains a multipage web application developed using Streamlit. This was a Intro to Data Science project developed by **Dorothy Oteng**, **Brianna King**, **Eke Agbai**, and **Juliet Kuruvilla**. 

## Overview

The **data-science-HU** repository is a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks aimed at showcasing the data science process, from data collection to model deployment. The highlight of this repository is the Streamlit-based web application that provides an interactive interface for users to engage with the data and models.

### What is Streamlit?

[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create custom web apps for machine learning and data science. With just a few lines of Python code, Streamlit allows developers to turn data scripts into shareable web applications with interactive widgets, visualizations, and more.

## Contents

1. **Data Directory**: This directory contains datasets used in this project.
2. **Jupyter Notebooks**:
   - `Group_2_Crime_and_Incarceration_by_State_Analysis.ipynb`: Analysis of crime and incarceration by state.
3. **Python Scripts**:
   - `data_cleaning.py`: Script for cleaning data.
   - `data_collection.py`: Script for collecting data.
   - `data_exploration.py`: Script for exploring data.
   - `data_preparation.py`: Script for preparing data.
   - `main.py`: The main script for executing the pipeline and launching the Streamlit app.
   - `model_trng_eval_deplmt.py`: Information about model training, evaluation, and deployment.
   - `overview.py`: Provides an overview of the data and processes.

## Languages Used
